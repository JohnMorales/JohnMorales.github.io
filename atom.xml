    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m learning EmbjerJS, and it&rsquo;s a great framework. One of the things that I struggled with is that I thought it was a vanilla MVC javascript framework.
I said OK, I know MVC so this is great..then I read a few docs about how Ember view binding works and tried to create a quick prototype.
I could not get a simple form post working. Why?</p>

<h2>I assumed it was just an MVC framework.</h2>

<p>The View (in MVC) is in charge of presentation, is uses the attributes/methods from model to make determinations on how to render the UI.
Therefore the view reads from the model and sends events/commands to the controller.
The Controller (in MVC) is in charge of dealing with those commands, it handles requests and input from the user and makes things happen.</p>

<p>In the strict MVC pattern, Controllers are not responsible for is acting as a facade over the model.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a diagram of how I understand vanilla MVC:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/mvc.png"></p>

<h2>Back to my problem</h2>

<p>So I created a model object to match the form data, and the view pulled properties from it to show on the form as expected.
I have read about <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/binding-element-attributes/">Ember&rsquo;s view binding</a>, so after the user edited the form and clicked save, I expected my model to have those attributes automatically reflected on my model from the form, but it wasn&rsquo;t working.
obvisously I wasn&rsquo;t <em>getting</em> it.</p>

<h2>So I started working through their walkthrough.</h2>

<p>After 2 hours I completed their walkthrough and it hit me. This is not just an MVC framework,
<strong>it&rsquo;s a cross between a MVVM framework and a MVP framework.</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain..</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">MVVM</a> (Model-View-ViewModel) The Model object is <strong>not</strong> decorated with any properties that are view specific. (Which is true in EmberJS)
The View does not interact with the Model but instead interacts with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorated</a> Model called the ViewModel.
These decorations are UI specific to help facilate the view.
In addition to having UI specific fields, The ViewModel object can also constructed in a way that it hides away all the complexities of dealing with UIs where you have multiple models in order to render a view.
Therefore the View just needs to communicate ViewModel and not have to know the relationships between models.</p>

<p>But there is no concept of ViewModel in EmberJS. So the Controllers play that role.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">MVP</a>, (Model-View-Presenter) The presenter does what normally the controller would do in MVC (handle commands from the user).
It also has the added responsiblity of creating methods that help the presentation (thus presenter).
Methods like hiding/showing logic and handling staleness dependencies of controls can all be handled by the presenter to keep the view simple.</p>

<p>But there is no concept of a Presenter in EmberJS. So the Controllers play that role.</p>

<p>In EmberJS it&rsquo;s more of a straight line:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/em_mvc.png"></p>

<p>Note that the default controller implementation proxies &lsquo;gets&rsquo; from the view to the backing model so that it feels more like the vanilla MVC.</p>

<p>Once I was able to understand that, it was clear what my problem was. I expected once the user issued the &lsquo;save&rsquo; command the model would reflect the form data (via Ember&rsquo;s view binding).
But it was the Controller that received all the form data. I needed to set the data on the model and was able to get a simple form post!</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone understand EmberJS better as it did for me..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just wanted to follow up on using rails composer. After speaking with <a href="http://ryan.mcgeary.org/">Ryan McGeary</a>, I&rsquo;ve since decided that using rails composer wasn&rsquo;t the right tool for this job.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rail composer sets up more stuff than I need, and it would take some work trimming out some of the gems/files it has.</li>
<li>Devise was more than I needed for the scope of the project that I need.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s even questionable whether or not I should use rails.</li>
<li>I want to learn a new JavaScript MVC framework. (I chose EmberJS)</li>
<li>It also reduces the need for another node in the system I&rsquo;m trying to create.</li>

    <id>http://JohnMorales.github.io/blog/2014/01/22/emberjs-the-id-property-must-be-defined-as-a-number-or-string-for-fixture</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating my first application using EmberJS and I recieved the following error:</p>

<p><code>the id property must be defined as a number or string for fixture</code>.</p>

<p>This occurred when I was simply trying to save the model after the user clicks the action.
I was a little confused by this error, because if you try to define an id property in the model EmberJS yells at you with this message:</p>

<p><code>You may not set 'id' as an attribute on your model.</code></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read that it&rsquo;s the store&rsquo;s job to assign the id of the model record.
It turns out that this is due to using <code>DS.FixtureAdapter</code>, instead of the <code>DS.RESTAdapter</code>.</p>

<p>It turns out that the use case for the FixtureAdapter is when you want to build an app and don&rsquo;t want to be concerned with the backend.
In other words, the RESTAdapter would actually send the restful requests to an endpoint for your crud and verb actions. Where as the FixtureAdapter is a stub.
For example, a front-end developer that is only in charge of the UI and doesn&rsquo;t want to setup the dependencies for the backend.
This way you could mimick the responses that you would get from a real backend. This is why EmberJS is asking for an id:</p>

<h3>FixtureAdapter is faking a <em>real</em> backend</h3>

<p>And a real backend is required to set one.</p>

    <link href="http://JohnMorales.github.io/blog/2014/01/15/how-to-cherry-pick-git-commit-using-tig/"/>

    <id>http://JohnMorales.github.io/blog/2014/01/15/how-to-cherry-pick-git-commit-using-tig</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Recently I needed to grab a commit that was on a release branch and bring it over to the master branch. We weren&rsquo;t ready to merge the whole branch and but I needed a specific commit.</p>

<p>I do not want to have a merge conflict when the release branch is merged back into master.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Git supports this via cherry-pick. This approach allows git to know that the commit that was cherry picked can be skipped when merging the branch to the destination containing the cherry-picked commit.</p>

<p>I was able to use tig to accomplish this by doing the following:</p>

<p>checkout the destination branch:  <code>git checkout master</code></p>

<p>then open <code>tig</code></p>

<p>then press &lsquo;b&rsquo; to see all the branches
<img src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/all_branches.png"></p>

<p>then select the branch that contains the commit you want</p>

<p>once you select the commit you want press &lsquo;P&rsquo; (case sensitive)</p>

<p><img src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/cherry_pick.png"></p>

<p>the commit should now be on master <code>git push origin</code> to push the change.</p>
