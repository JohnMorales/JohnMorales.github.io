    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using base16 as my terminal color scheme for a while now, I used to
use solarized. I&rsquo;ve been pleased with the results.  Over all the base 16 suite
is a great looking set of themes that works well in the shell and in vim.
<a href="https://github.com/chriskempson">Chris</a> has done a great job on it.</p>

<p>One of the issues that I&rsquo;ve had is my setup was theme specific, meaning after I
chose a theme, I was committed and switching colorschemes mid-coding session was
painful. There were ad-hoc times where the visibility of a light theme was
crucial to taking pride of my environment. Basically:</p>

<h2>Dark themes + shitty projectors == :(</h2>

<p>Typically I use a dark theme, but when I have do an ad-hoc presentation or
someone comes over to pair program, it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes to use a light
theme.</p>

<h2>Attempt 1: iTerm Profiles + Environment variables</h2>

<p>Intially I created dedicated iTerm profiles so that I can
<a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2"><strong>import</strong></a> the correct
colorscheme which would set the 16 ansi colors to the exact color. I had my
<code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.vimrc</code> check the <strong>ITERM_PROFILE</strong> setting provided by iTerm to set the
proper themes in tmux and vim. The
solution roughly consisted of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Manually Create a new iTerm profile titled with the name of the base16 theme
I wanted to use. e.g. <code>base16-default.dark</code></li>
<li>Manually update my bashrc to include logic to source the right iterm-shell
init script. The bashrc would also tell tmux to source the right color
schemes.</li>
<li>Manually update my vimrc to set the right colorscheme and background
accordingly</li>
</ol>


<p>While this worked for the most part, it required creating a new iTerm and was
pretty kludgy overall.</p>

<p>The <strong>biggest problem</strong> was that switching profiles wouldn&rsquo;t change the
ITERM_PROFILE environment variable in tmux. Since tmux is a client/server app
it would hold on to the ITERM_PROFILE that was initially used when the tmux
server was created. Therefore creating new tmux shells would have the original
theme not the latest.</p>

<h2>Attempt 2: (Current solution) auto-generated bash functions</h2>

<p>I created a <code>profiler_helper.sh</code> that will automatically create
<code>base16_{theme}_{dark|light}</code> functions that will quickly switch to that theme.
in addition the functions will create <code>~/.vimrc_background</code> and <code>~/.base16_theme</code>
files. These files allow the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>.vimrc_background</code> file will configure vim to use the latest use base16 profile.</li>
<li>the <code>.base16_theme</code> is a soft link to the latest activated theme so that it
can be sourced newly created shell</li>
</ul>


<h3>In action</h3>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/johnmorales_blog/base16_profile_helpers.gif"></p>

<h3>Super quick setup:</h3>

<p>Until I convince <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson">Chris</a> to include this in his project, clone my fork</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git clone https://github.com/JohnMorales/base16-shell</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Add the following to your bashrc <em>(change the location to match where you&rsquo;ve cloned the base-16 shell)</em>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>if [ -n "$PS1" ]; then # if statement guards adding these helpers for non-interative shells
</span><span class='line'>  eval "$(~/Development/base-16/shell/profile_helper.sh)"
</span><span class='line'>fi</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Add the following to your vimrc:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>if filereadable(expand("~/.vimrc_background"))
</span><span class='line'>  let base16colorspace=256
</span><span class='line'>  source ~/.vimrc_background
</span><span class='line'>endif</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>In new shells, use the bash functions to change the color scheme:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ base16_default_dark</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Quick and painless color switching, Enjoy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sitting at the SFO airport trying to digest everything that I was exposed
to after 3 intense days of Chef sessions and meeting the awesome chef
community.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>One thing that I learned is that Chef as a company is cool and laid back. I was
taken by surprise on how cool they are. After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P0HD5pE-zU">Nathen Harvey&rsquo;s
presentation</a> and then the open
bar rock band show I realized how down to earth and funny they are. Even
everyone that I met at all the hallway sessions were friends I hadn&rsquo;t met yet.
I felt wow these guys are genuinely awesome. I was initially skeptical because
I thought that everyone was a little too nice and friendly, but by the end I
was convinced that this is an awesome community, that I&rsquo;m glad to be a part of.</p>

<h2>Message</h2>

<p>The message that I recieved from the conference was that we as IT professionals
have the power to change companies. We need to fully embrace the idea of
continous delivery (which admittely I need to learn more about). That the
devops movement is a shift in how software is maintained and that the shift
requires more transparency, acceptance and trust than just adding a new
&lsquo;configuration management&rsquo; tool.  I learned that it&rsquo;s about building trust in
the process. Showing real success stories in baby steps so that everyone can
realize the potential that we sell them in slide decks and proposals.</p>

<p>Lastly the idea that we are all working together to make
the software development process more delightful. By implementing a process
that reduces the friction in changes we&rsquo;re able to respond faster and provide
value.</p>

<h2>Call to action</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though this post doesn&rsquo;t technically have anything to do with Mocha, I&rsquo;m
mentioning it in the title because I was using Mocha, but Mocha has a gap of
features when it comes to testing http interactions. You need to augment it
with another module.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with NodeJS and trying to experiment creating
a web backend that will handle form posts from my simple html web page. In
order to test the simple express app I wanted to use mocha.</p>

<p>After installing mocha and express I created my handler but wanted a way to
fake the requests. I couldn&rsquo;t fiqure out how to test the application so I
started googling to see what was recommended. I found a post on
<a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/languages/nodejs/getting-started-express-and-mocha.html">wrecker</a>
showing to use supertest.</p>

<p>I then started to look to make sure that supertest is
in fact the right tool that I need. I couldn&rsquo;t find a definitive direction on
how to test web form requests using node so I&rsquo;m posting this.</p>

<p>I confirmed simply by <a href="https://github.com/koajs/statsd/commit/2d22eeee009eff704f2ba2da36be0c50991f3530">reviewing code from the one of the nodejs contributors</a>
and confirmed that he is using supertest to test their http interactions.</p>

    <link href="http://JohnMorales.github.io/blog/2014/01/26/embjerjs-is-a-more-than-just-model-view-controller/"/>

    <id>http://JohnMorales.github.io/blog/2014/01/26/embjerjs-is-a-more-than-just-model-view-controller</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m learning EmbjerJS, and it&rsquo;s a great framework. One of the things that I struggled with is that I thought it was a vanilla MVC javascript framework.
I said OK, I know MVC so this is great..then I read a few docs about how Ember view binding works and tried to create a quick prototype.
I could not get a simple form post working. Why?</p>

<h2>I assumed it was just an MVC framework.</h2>

<p>The View (in MVC) is in charge of presentation, is uses the attributes/methods from model to make determinations on how to render the UI.
Therefore the view reads from the model and sends events/commands to the controller.
The Controller (in MVC) is in charge of dealing with those commands, it handles requests and input from the user and makes things happen.</p>

<p>In the strict MVC pattern, Controllers are not responsible for is acting as a facade over the model.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a diagram of how I understand vanilla MVC:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/mvc.png"></p>

<h2>Back to my problem</h2>

<p>So I created a model object to match the form data, and the view pulled properties from it to show on the form as expected.
I have read about <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/templates/binding-element-attributes/">Ember&rsquo;s view binding</a>, so after the user edited the form and clicked save, I expected my model to have those attributes automatically reflected on my model from the form, but it wasn&rsquo;t working.
obvisously I wasn&rsquo;t <em>getting</em> it.</p>

<h2>So I started working through their walkthrough.</h2>

<p>After 2 hours I completed their walkthrough and it hit me. This is not just an MVC framework,
<strong>it&rsquo;s a cross between a MVVM framework and a MVP framework.</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain..</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">MVVM</a> (Model-View-ViewModel) The Model object is <strong>not</strong> decorated with any properties that are view specific. (Which is true in EmberJS)
The View does not interact with the Model but instead interacts with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorated</a> Model called the ViewModel.
These decorations are UI specific to help facilate the view.
In addition to having UI specific fields, The ViewModel object can also constructed in a way that it hides away all the complexities of dealing with UIs where you have multiple models in order to render a view.
Therefore the View just needs to communicate ViewModel and not have to know the relationships between models.</p>

<p>But there is no concept of ViewModel in EmberJS. So the Controllers play that role.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">MVP</a>, (Model-View-Presenter) The presenter does what normally the controller would do in MVC (handle commands from the user).
It also has the added responsiblity of creating methods that help the presentation (thus presenter).
Methods like hiding/showing logic and handling staleness dependencies of controls can all be handled by the presenter to keep the view simple.</p>

<p>But there is no concept of a Presenter in EmberJS. So the Controllers play that role.</p>

<p>In EmberJS it&rsquo;s more of a straight line:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/em_mvc.png"></p>

<p>Note that the default controller implementation proxies &lsquo;gets&rsquo; from the view to the backing model so that it feels more like the vanilla MVC.</p>

<p>Once I was able to understand that, it was clear what my problem was. I expected once the user issued the &lsquo;save&rsquo; command the model would reflect the form data (via Ember&rsquo;s view binding).
But it was the Controller that received all the form data. I needed to set the data on the model and was able to get a simple form post!</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone understand EmberJS better as it did for me..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating my first application using EmberJS and I recieved the following error:</p>

<p><code>the id property must be defined as a number or string for fixture</code>.</p>

<p>This occurred when I was simply trying to save the model after the user clicks the action.
I was a little confused by this error, because if you try to define an id property in the model EmberJS yells at you with this message:</p>

<p><code>You may not set 'id' as an attribute on your model.</code></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read that it&rsquo;s the store&rsquo;s job to assign the id of the model record.
It turns out that this is due to using <code>DS.FixtureAdapter</code>, instead of the <code>DS.RESTAdapter</code>.</p>

<p>It turns out that the use case for the FixtureAdapter is when you want to build an app and don&rsquo;t want to be concerned with the backend.
In other words, the RESTAdapter would actually send the restful requests to an endpoint for your crud and verb actions. Where as the FixtureAdapter is a stub.
For example, a front-end developer that is only in charge of the UI and doesn&rsquo;t want to setup the dependencies for the backend.
This way you could mimick the responses that you would get from a real backend. This is why EmberJS is asking for an id:</p>

<h3>FixtureAdapter is faking a <em>real</em> backend</h3>

<p>And a real backend is required to set one.</p>

    <id>http://JohnMorales.github.io/blog/2014/01/15/how-to-cherry-pick-git-commit-using-tig</id>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Recently I needed to grab a commit that was on a release branch and bring it over to the master branch. We weren&rsquo;t ready to merge the whole branch and but I needed a specific commit.</p>

<p>I do not want to have a merge conflict when the release branch is merged back into master.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Git supports this via cherry-pick. This approach allows git to know that the commit that was cherry picked can be skipped when merging the branch to the destination containing the cherry-picked commit.</p>

<p>I was able to use tig to accomplish this by doing the following:</p>

<p>checkout the destination branch:  <code>git checkout master</code></p>

<p>then open <code>tig</code></p>

<p>then press &lsquo;b&rsquo; to see all the branches
<img src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/all_branches.png"></p>

<p>then select the branch that contains the commit you want</p>

<p>once you select the commit you want press &lsquo;P&rsquo; (case sensitive)</p>

<p><img src="http://JohnMorales.github.io/images/cherry_pick.png"></p>

<p>the commit should now be on master <code>git push origin</code> to push the change.</p>
