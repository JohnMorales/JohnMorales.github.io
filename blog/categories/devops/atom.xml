    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sitting at the SFO airport trying to digest everything that I was exposed
to after 3 intense days of Chef sessions and meeting the awesome chef
community.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>One thing that I learned is that Chef as a company is cool and laid back. I was
taken by surprise on how cool they are. After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P0HD5pE-zU">Nathan Harvey&rsquo;s
presentation</a> and then the open
bar rock band show I realized how down to earth and funny they are. Even
everyone that I met at all the hallway sessions were friends I hadn&rsquo;t met yet.
I felt wow these guys are genuinely awesome. I was initially skeptical because
I thought that everyone was a little too nice and friendly, but by the end I
was convinced that this is an awesome community, that I&rsquo;m glad to be a part of.</p>

<h2>Message</h2>

<p>The message that I recieved from the conference was that we as IT professionals
have the power to change companies. We need to fully embrace the idea of
continous delivery (which admittely I need to learn more about). That the
devops movement is a shift in how software is maintained and that the shift
requires more transparency, acceptance and trust than just adding a new
&lsquo;configuration management&rsquo; tool.  I learned that it&rsquo;s about building trust in
the process. Showing real success stories in baby steps so that everyone can
realize the potential that we sell them in slide decks and proposals.</p>

<p>Lastly the idea that we are all working together to make
the software development process more delightful. By implementing a process
that reduces the friction in changes we&rsquo;re able to respond faster and provide
value.</p>
