I've decided to use rails composer for an app that I'm building. For those that don't know [rails composer is "like the Rails generator on steroids."](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/)

I looked at a few generators and most of them were old, but it was a toss up with rails composer and [suspenders](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders). I ended up choosing rails composer but I haven't done a pros and cons evaluation between them.

Stay tuned for my review on using rails composer.
