I'm sitting at the SFO airport trying to digest everything that I was exposed
to after 3 intense days of Chef sessions and meeting the awesome chef
community.

## Community
One thing that I learned is that Chef as a company is cool and laid back. I was
taken by surprise on how cool they are. After watching [Nathan Harvey's
presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P0HD5pE-zU) and then the open
bar rock band show I realized how down to earth and funny they are. Even
everyone that I met at all the hallway sessions were friends I hadn't met yet.
I felt wow these guys are genuinely awesome. I was initially skeptical because
I thought that everyone was a little too nice and friendly, but by the end I
was convinced that this is an awesome community, that I'm glad to be a part of.

## Message
The message that I recieved from the conference was that we as IT professionals
have the power to change companies. We need to fully embrace the idea of
continous delivery (which admittely I need to learn more about). That the
devops movement is a shift in how software is maintained and that the shift
requires more transparency, acceptance and trust than just adding a new
'configuration management' tool.  I learned that it's about building trust in
the process. Showing real success stories in baby steps so that everyone can
realize the potential that we sell them in slide decks and proposals.

Lastly the idea that we are all working together to make
the software development process more delightful. By implementing a process
that reduces the friction in changes we're able to respond faster and provide
value.

## Call to action
- Be a prophet of the devops movement.
- Make sure I lead a healthy life, since unhealthy lives suck.
