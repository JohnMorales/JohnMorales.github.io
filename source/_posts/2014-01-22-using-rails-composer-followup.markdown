I just wanted to follow up on using rails composer. After speaking with [Ryan McGeary](http://ryan.mcgeary.org/), I've since decided that using rails composer wasn't the right tool for this job.

* Rail composer sets up more stuff than I need, and it would take some work trimming out some of the gems/files it has.
* Devise was more than I needed for the scope of the project that I need. 
* It's even questionable whether or not I should use rails.
* I want to learn a new JavaScript MVC framework. (I chose EmberJS)
* It also reduces the need for another node in the system I'm trying to create.
