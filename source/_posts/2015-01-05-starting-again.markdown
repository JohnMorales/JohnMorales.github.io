It's a little cliche that I'm starting to blog again exactly the same time I tried this last year, which just so happens to fall in right after the new years. 
But I promise it's not a resolution or anything ;) I think part of the problem was that I was drinking from a firehose for the better part of last year since I switched over to be a contractor.
Now I think I should be in a better place where I can devote time to writing.
